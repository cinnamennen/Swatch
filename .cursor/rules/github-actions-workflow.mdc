      # GitHub Actions Workflow Best Practices

      ## General Guidelines
      - Use specific versions for all actions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v3` not `actions/checkout@main`)
      - Run jobs on Ubuntu unless Windows/macOS is specifically required
      - Set up proper dependencies with `needs:` for sequential jobs
      - Include proper error handling and conditional logic

      ## Specific to This Project
      - Always install OpenSCAD and PrusaSlicer as core dependencies
      - Set up clear output paths for artifacts
      - Upload both 3MF and GCODE files as artifacts
      - Create releases with descriptive tags and body text
      - Process all materials in CSV files automatically

      ## Security Considerations
      - Never expose sensitive credentials in logs or environment variables
      - Use GitHub Secrets for any sensitive information
      - Restrict GitHub token permissions to the minimum required
</rule>

## Example Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Generate Swatches

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'materials/**'
      - 'swatch/**'
      - 'scripts/**'
      - '.github/workflows/generate-swatches.yml'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Job implementation
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Missing dependencies for OpenSCAD/PrusaSlicer
- Incorrect path references for cross-platform compatibility
- Failing to check command exit codes
- Not handling errors gracefully
