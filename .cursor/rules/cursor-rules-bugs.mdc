      # Cursor Rules Known Bugs and Workarounds

      ## üìù File Creation Issues
      
      1. **Always use the .mdc extension**
         - Rules must have the .mdc extension to be recognized
         - This requirement is currently undocumented
      
      2. **File Location Requirements**
         - Rules must be in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
         - Subdirectories within rules/ are not currently supported

      ## üíæ Saving Issues
      
      Saving .mdc files is problematic - changes often don't persist despite appearing to save.
      
      **Workarounds for saving:**
      
      1. **Command Palette Method:**
         - Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` > `New Cursor Rule`
         - This creates properly formatted rules
      
      2. **Close and Override Method:**
         - After editing, close Cursor completely
         - When prompted about "Unsaved Changes"
         - Select the "Override" option
         - Reopen Cursor to see if changes persisted
      
      3. **Extension Swap Method:**
         - Create as .md file first
         - Add proper frontmatter
         - Save normally
         - Rename to .mdc
      
      4. **External Editor Method:**
         - Copy content from Cursor
         - Edit in another text editor
         - Save and check results

      ## üîç Validation
      
      After editing, always verify your changes persisted:
      ```bash
      cat .cursor/rules/your-rule-name.mdc
      ```
      
      ## üìã Frontmatter Format
      
      Always include proper frontmatter:
      ```yaml

## Detailed Explanation

This bug was reported and discussed in the [Cursor forum thread](https://forum.cursor.com/t/bug-rules-in-rules-folder-require-undocumented-mdc-format-and-special-save-process/50379).

### Known Issues

1. **Extension Requirements**
   - Rules **must** use the `.mdc` extension
   - This requirement is undocumented in official guides

2. **Saving Behavior**
   - Normal save operations (Ctrl+S, menu save) often fail silently
   - The editor displays the changes but they aren't persisted
   - No error message or indication that the save failed

3. **Frontmatter Requirements**
   - Rules require proper YAML frontmatter
   - Missing or malformed frontmatter can cause rules to be ignored

### Alternative Approaches

If you're having persistent issues with rules:

1. Consider using a `.cursorrules` file in the project root
2. Use the command palette for creating new rules
3. Edit rules in an external editor
