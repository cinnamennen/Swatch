# OpenSCAD Guidelines

Guidelines for maintaining and modifying OpenSCAD files in the swatch generator project.

      # OpenSCAD Best Practices

      ## Code Structure
      - Use modules for reusable components
      - Place constants and parameters at the top of the file
      - Use descriptive variable names (`layer_height` not `lh`)
      - Add comments for complex operations

      ## Parameters
      - All swatches must support the following parameters:
        - `MATERIAL`: Material type (string)
        - `BRAND`: Brand name (string)
        - `COLOR`: Color name (string)
        - `NOZZLE_TEMP`: Temperature in celsius (number)
        - `LAYER_HEIGHT`: Layer height in mm (number)

      ## Modeling Guidelines
      - Ensure text is properly sized and has sufficient depth
      - Keep wall thickness at least 2x nozzle diameter
      - Add chamfers to sharp edges when possible
      - Design for printability without supports
      - Use the BOSL2 library for complex geometry
</rule>

## Common Issues

- Text too small or shallow
- Overlapping geometry causing manifold errors
- Excessive polygon count causing slowdowns

## Examples

```scad
// Good practice - parametric values
module swatch_text(material, brand, color, temp) {
  // Implementation
}

// Bad practice - hardcoded values
module swatch_text() {
  text("PLA", size=10);
}
```
