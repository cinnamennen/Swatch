# Automated Testing

Runs automated tests when important files change to ensure pipeline integrity.

      Pipeline tests have been run. If all tests passed, consider committing your changes with:
      
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "feat(component): brief description of changes"
      ```
      
      If tests failed, check:
      - Log output for specific errors
      - Test fixtures for outdated expectations
      - Environment configuration
      
      Common testing fixes:
      1. Update expected output in test fixtures
      2. Check for missing dependencies
      3. Ensure OpenSCAD and PrusaSlicer are correctly installed
      4. Verify material profiles exist in slicer-profiles directory
</rule>

## Test Categories

The test pipeline runs several types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions in isolation
   - Verify correct behavior with known inputs
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction between components
   - Verify OpenSCAD model generation
   - Check PrusaSlicer processing

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test the complete pipeline from material definition to GCODE
   - Verify ironing settings are correctly applied
   - Validate output file structure and content

## Test Configuration

Tests can be configured through:

```
tests/config.json
```

Settings include:
- Test material configurations
- Mock dependencies
- Expected output templates

## Adding New Tests

When adding features, always add corresponding tests:

1. Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
2. Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
3. End-to-end tests in `tests/e2e/`
