      ## Common Issues to Check
      
      If validation failed, check for:
      
      1. **Manifold Problems**
         - Non-watertight mesh
         - Overlapping faces
         - Zero-thickness walls
      
      2. **Dimensional Issues**
         - Text too small for nozzle diameter
         - Features below printable resolution
         - Insufficient clearance between parts
      
      3. **Printer Compatibility**
         - Model exceeds build volume
         - Unsupported overhangs
         - Material-specific limitations
</rule>

## Validation Process

The validation script performs the following checks:

1. **File Integrity**
   - File exists and has correct format
   - File size is reasonable
   - File can be parsed by appropriate tools

2. **Mesh Quality**
   - Check for non-manifold edges
   - Verify all normals are consistent
   - Ensure minimum wall thickness

3. **Print Compatibility**
   - Verify dimensions fit target printers
   - Check for printability issues
   - Validate against material constraints

## Troubleshooting

When validation fails:

1. **OpenSCAD Issues**
   - Adjust model parameters
   - Check for self-intersecting geometry
   - Use preview mode to identify problem areas

2. **Slicing Issues**
   - Verify PrusaSlicer settings
   - Check material compatibility
   - Review printer profiles
