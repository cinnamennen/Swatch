      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

      5. IMPORTANT: Known issues with saving .mdc files
         - Normal save commands may not work for .mdc files
         - If changes aren't persisting, use one of these workarounds:
           a. Use command palette: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > "New Cursor Rule"
           b. Close Cursor completely, select "Override" when prompted
           c. Create as .md first, then rename to .mdc
           d. Copy content and edit in a different editor
</rule>

## Examples

- **Bad: Rule file in wrong location**
  ```
  rules/my-rule.mdc
  my-rule.mdc
  .rules/my-rule.mdc
  ```

- **Good: Rule file in correct location**
  ```
  .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
  ```

## Known Bugs and Workarounds

There are currently some issues with creating and editing .mdc files:

1. **Files must use .mdc extension**
   - Rules must have the .mdc extension to be recognized
   - This is currently undocumented in official documentation

2. **Saving issues with .mdc files**
   - Normal save commands often don't persist changes
   - Cursor AI may show changes that aren't actually saved

3. **Workarounds for editing rules:**
   - **Method 1:** Use command palette `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` > `New Cursor Rule`
   - **Method 2:** When editing existing rules:
     1. Close Cursor completely after editing
     2. When prompted about "Unsaved Changes"
     3. Select the "Override" option
     4. Reopen Cursor to see changes
   - **Method 3:** Have the agent create files as .md first, then rename to .mdc
   - **Method 4:** Copy content from Cursor and paste into another editor

## Validation

After creating or editing a rule, verify it was saved correctly:
```bash
# Check file content outside of Cursor
cat .cursor/rules/your-rule-name.mdc
```
