# Project Architecture Reference

This rule provides a reference to the project's architecture as documented in the README.

          # Swatch Generator Pipeline Architecture

          The project follows a two-phase architecture:

          ## Phase 1: Model Generation
          1. **Base Model Generation** - OpenSCAD creates 3D model with material parameters
          2. **Printer-Specific Configuration** - PrusaSlicer applies printer settings and enables ironing

          ## Phase 2: Slicing
          1. **GCODE Generation** - PrusaSlicer slices the 3MF file with built-in ironing

          See README.md for more detailed architecture information.

          # Material Handling Reference

          Materials are defined in CSV files with the following format:
          ```csv
          Material,Brand,Color,FilamentProfile,Temperature
          PLA,Prusament,Galaxy Black,Prusament PLA,215
          PETG,Generic,Blue,Generic PETG,230
          ```

          The system supports all Prusa-compatible materials with printer-specific profiles.
</rule>

## Usage

This rule activates when:
- You're editing core project files 
- You ask about project architecture or pipeline
- You reference materials or filament handling

## Design Philosophy

The project aims for:
- Complete automation without manual manipulation
- Material-specific optimization
- Using official PrusaSlicer profiles
- Automated ironing for top surfaces
