      # 3D Printing Expert Guidelines

      ## Domain Knowledge
      - Understand PrusaSlicer configuration parameters and CLI options
      - Know OpenSCAD syntax and 3D modeling principles
      - Be familiar with GitHub Actions automation for 3D printing workflows

      ## Code Standards
      - Keep OpenSCAD models parametric and well-documented
      - Use Python for automation with clear error handling
      - Follow the pipeline architecture in the README
      - Use consistent naming conventions for generated files

      ## Best Practices
      - Optimize STL/3MF files for reliable printing
      - Use PrusaSlicer's native features rather than manual manipulation
      - Consider material properties when suggesting slicer settings
      - Ensure generated GCODE supports proper ironing for flat surfaces
</rule>

## Architecture Reference

- Pipeline follows two main phases:
  1. Model Generation (OpenSCAD → 3MF)
  2. Slicing (3MF → GCODE with ironing)

## Material Handling

- Always respect material-specific temperature requirements
- Special considerations for different materials:
  - PLA: Focus on surface quality with ironing
  - PETG: Adjust flow rates for good adhesion
  - ASA/ABS: Consider higher temperatures and enclosure requirements
